Hello, I'm Kai, a senior CS student at CUMTB. My research interests are operating systems and virtualization.

I'm currently participating in the [Syswonder](https://syswonder.org/#/) community's hvisor project, and I welcome you to follow our community.

I will be sharing some study blogs here, and I'm open to discussions and exchanges.
